# Example-Data-Cleaning

This exercise was to show a download of data from three sources - student scores, teachers assigned to courses, and a list of all students. The goal was to process the data and deliver a spreadsheet for an upload.

There is a comprehensive walkthrough of the work in the Jupyter Notebook, outlining the various steps taken to:
- Inspect the data
- Remove duplicate values
- Join the data
- Produce the desired output
- Conduct some lite analysis

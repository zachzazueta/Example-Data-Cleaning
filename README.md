# Example-Data-Cleaning

This exercise was to show a download of data from three sources - student scores, teachers assigned to courses, and a list of all students. The goal was to process the data and deliver a spreadsheet for an upload.

There is a comprehensive walkthrough of the work in the Jupyter Notebook, outlining the various steps taken to inspect the data, remove duplicate values, join the data, produce the desired output, and conduct some lite analysis.
